        "description": "The office is cluttered with papers, books, and empty coffee cups. A large window overlooks the busy street outside, but it's sealed shut. The walls are adorned with pictures of past cases and a diploma from a detective academy. There's a locked door, the only exit, with an electronic keypad requiring a code. A sturdy wooden desk occupies the center of the room, supporting a computer, a phone, and a small safe with a combination lock. A tall bookshelf crammed with books and trinkets stands against the opposite wall. A note on the desk reads: 'Remember, the key to freedom is hidden in the past.' A fedora [brown, +1 Cool] and a tan trench coat [+2 Cool] hang on a coat rack near the door.",
